# BookWorm
This project was made as my final project for my full-stack bootcamp.

It is a social media app for book lovers. My intention was to make a barebones version of Goodreads where users can favorite books, post book reviews, and interact with eachtother through commenting on eachothers reviews.

*Styling is not my strong point, so the CSS for this project is pretty minimal. That being said, I am currently learning TailwindCSS and might redesign this project in the future.
